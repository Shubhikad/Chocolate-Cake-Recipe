Notes
The cake batter will be very thin after adding the boiling water. This is correct and results in the most delicious and moist chocolate cake Iâ€™ve ever tasted! xo
Freezer Friendly

Let the baked cake layers cool completely. Wrap them well with plastic wrap and then with foil. Put each layer into a freezer bag and freeze up to 2 months. To serve, thaw in the refrigerator overnight with wrapping intact. The next day, the layers are ready to fill and frost.

High Altitude: If you live at a high altitude, adjust the recipe based upon the altitude for your area.
